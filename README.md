# fff-dataviz-resources
Just a collection of Data Visualization resources curated by MPJ from Fun Fun Function. Pull requests welcome - for now, just a rather unstructured thing, but will probably become a web resource later maybe.

Only one category so far but more will be added:

####[Directories and feeds](/directories-and-feeds.md)
This particular section doesn't strive to be a comprehensive list of indiviudial visualization, but rather a meta-resource where one can mine around to find interesting examples of how visualization can be done - it is a mix of directories, awards and news outlets.
